## What are Claude Skills?
Skills are Markdown instruction files that teach Claude Code your 
personal standards, preferences, and patterns — so you don't repeat 
yourself every session.

Read a skill at the start of a task:
> "Read `calculated-fields.md` then help me write a LOD expression for..."

## Available Skills
| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| `calculated-fields.md` | Formulas, LODs, table calcs, naming conventions |
| `chart-type-decisions.md` | Chart recommendations, colour rules, what to avoid |

## How to use these skills
1. Download the `.md` file(s) you want
2. Add them to your project under `.claude/skills/`
3. Reference them at the start of a Claude Code session
